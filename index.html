			<h1>Hi there,</h1>
			<p>
				Iâ€™m a PhD student in Department of Physiology at McGill University. My research involves studying mechanisms of synchronization in pyramidal sensory neurons. Synchronization plays an important role in population coding that gives rise to perception and behavior since it carries information about the natural stimuli. My goal is developing a mathematical model of pyramidal cells that helps us to study the functional role of intrinsic phyiological elements at the single cell level, as well as extracelullar parameters on the burst firing pattern of individual neurons and the induced synchrony through burst across neural populations.
