			<h1>Hi there, I'm Amin Akhshi</h1>
			<p>
				I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Physiology department at McGill University.
				As a computational neurophysiologist with a good background in complex systems, I'm studying the mechanisms underlying synchronization in neural networks.
				This is an interdisciplinary field focusing on how neurons encode information in the brain that could lead to perception and behavior.
				I have extensive knowledge in using computational and mathematical techniques on experimental data.
				This includes machine learning, signal processing, mathematical modeling, data analysis, statistical methods, etc. and their applications to solve real
				worlds problems in various areas including neuroscience, biophysics, climatology, financial markets, and astrophysics. 
				Part of my researches have contributed in two manuscripts in collaboration with Dr. Lehnertz laboratory at department of epileptology at hospital university 
				of Bonn in Germany as well as Dr. Rahimi Tabar laboratory at department of physics at Sharif University of Technology in Iran
				which are published in Scientific Reports journal.
