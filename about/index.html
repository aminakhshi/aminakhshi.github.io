			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Physiology department at McGill University. As a computational neurophysiologist with backgrounds in complex systems, I'm studying brain dynamics in sensory nervous systems and how neural populations encode incoming information that leads to perception and behavior in vertebrates. I have extensive knowledge on application of computational approaches including deep learning, machine learning, signal processing, mathematical modeling, data analysis, statistical methods, etc. and their applications to solve real worlds problems in various areas in neuroscience, biophysics, climatology, financial markets, and astrophysics. Part of my research has contributed in two manuscripts in collaboration with Dr. Lehnertz laboratory at department of epileptology at hospital university of Bonn in Germany as well as Dr. Rahimi Tabar laboratory at department of physics at Sharif University of Technology in Iran which are published in Scientific Reports journal. During my work as a student and as an employee in Aerial Technologies company over the last 4 years, I have gained extensive experience on leadership skills, performing organizational tasks, programming skills, data processing, visualization, cloud-based platforms, and analytical techniques, and their applications in different projects including wifi-based human activity recognition, time series analysis, and physics.</p>
